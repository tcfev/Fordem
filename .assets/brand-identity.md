# Brand Strategy Session - ForDem

GOAL

Vision → Actions → Expression → Experience

## Purpose

### Purpose

Why do we do this?

1. **why** - iranian people do not have a e-democracy platform that has tools to connect, coordinate, communicate all in one (currently done with twitter, meta, telegram).
2. **why**- e-democracy → need for transparency so users can come to a collective social decision and have a say with the evolution of the platform. 
3. **why** - social decisions → wanting to maximize participation and all participation social-political mobilization
4. **why** - participation → in the democratic system you need to be able to hear everybody. to go beyond just a binary system of yes or no. Want to utilize among others a ranking system so people’s voices are heard. 
5. **why** - people’s voices to be heard → to better understand where people’s ideals align and what the needs of everyone is so no one is left out. Give people a voice when it comes to basic human rights and how they live their lives. Allow ideas to be heard by everyone.

### Mission

What do we do to achieve the purpose

Observe the bottle necks and provide solutions. Create the infrastructure (while using the existing ones) to create a solution that will better connect people through a cohesive platform.

### Vision

How will the world look like if we achieve our purpose?

Education about basic rights in different languages available to different ages. With this knowledge, where connected people will propose ideas, ideas will the sorted out, and best ideas will be mobilized upon.

### Step 1: Collect Information

- What are they doing (products/services)
    - Creating an application that will allow people to connect, deliberate, vote, organize, take action, self-reflect effectively.
- Who are they?
    - non-profit, non-governmental, civic-lab registered in Germany. Made up of a multi-national team participatory justice activists.
- How they got into doing it?
    - Team members have either been highly aware of what is going on in Iran, while others have personal experience and would like to see change.
- Who else is doing it? How are they different?
    - there are a number who are doing something similar, but ForDem is focusing on decentralization and peer-2-peer connections, simplification of networking AI allowing users to connect with users with similar interests. Allow easy connections that are related to your interests in various categories. Everyone who joins the network is able the join the legal entity and have a say in how the platform evolves. Economy where if a for-profit entity uses content from the platform, the money produced using that content would mainly go back to the uses who created that content with 10% going to the platform for moderation.
- Why are they doing it?
    - ***Would like to make a better world and to make a better world we need to find a collective truth. Create something sustainable collectively.***

### Step 2: Confront Inconsistencies

- Do they all agree on the why?
- Does the “why” contradicts something else they said?

### Step 3: Refine the Message

- If there are multiple versions, craft into a single statement

### Look & Feel

- References to things you love? **SIMPLICITY**
    - Mastodon - like the feel of it. you aren’t dependent on one entity and join different servers
    - Hacker News - simplicity while the discussions are deep
    - Reddit - likes how conversations take place. how categorization and specialization is done
    - Twitter - its simplicity
    - Consul - direct and to the point, participation
    - [https://pol.is/home](https://pol.is/home) - the simplicity of the website (built with notion)
    - **TECHNOLOGIES**
    - Consul
    - Decidim
    - firechat
    - bit torrent
    - LTE-D2D
    - wifi-direct
    - mesh-network
- References to things you DON’T love?
    - fake neutrality, platforms that are there for controversy and the money.
    - Twitter - no way to categorize things other than using hashtags, Elon Musk, give lots of privacy information (ie telephone number)
    - Mastodon - Doesn’t work on p2p networks, doesn’t have one code base
    - hacker news - **nested conversations are hard to follow and aren’t visually appealing**
    - reddit - the read more section, the suggested topics (doesn’t like the mixing of information that isn’t related to what I’m doing), having to click to see the rest of the conversation rather than just scrolling,
    - Consul* - doesn’t have different kinds of voting system. their systems aren’t connected to one another. (lots of limitation)
    - [https://pol.is/home](https://pol.is/home) - once you are further into the website there is a lot of information with a TON of links so it is hard to fully understand the information
    - the registering process to start using the platform
