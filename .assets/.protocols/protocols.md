## Topics: 
**I.** Authentication & Authorization of the backend.
Connected issue: https://github.com/tcfev/fordem-backend/issues/6

**II.** State management in Flutter
@zanzendegi:
We need to use vanilla Flutter because maintenance would be easier in the long run

@Lukas-h: 
We do not use BloC, but we need to have some paterns for the business logic and state management in order to prevent chaos.

@zanzendegi @lukas-h will propose the patterns. 

**III.** We also talked about separate repositories for the proto schemes. 
Decision: Can be added later. Under Flutter-side it is manual. On the backend side we have automated, therefore we can postpone it to another time. 

- Automate the compilation of the proto-schemes for the Github-actions.
