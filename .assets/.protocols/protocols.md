# Protocol | 2. Dec. 2022 | forDem Weekly 

Present members: 
@zanzendegi @Lukas-h @Armantorkzaban @drkangl90

## Topics: 
**I.** Authentication & Authorization of the backend.
Connected issue: https://github.com/tcfev/fordem-backend/issues/6

**II.** State management in Flutter
@zanzendegi:
We need to use vanilla Flutter because maintenance would be easier in the long run.

@Lukas-h: 
We do not use BloC, but we need to have some paterns for the business logic and state management in order to prevent chaos.

@zanzendegi @lukas-h will propose the patterns. 

**III.** We also talked about separate repositories for the proto schemes. 
Decision: Can be added later. On Flutter side code generation is manual. But, on the backend side we have it automated, therefore we can postpone it to another time.

- Automate the compilation of the proto-schemes for the Github-actions. 

IV. Project board is now unified under:[ForDem – Project planning](https://github.com/orgs/tcfev/projects/7)

V. @Armantorkzaban will clean up his calendar and offer Flutter coding time-slots - @zanzendegi will assign tasks to him if needed.
