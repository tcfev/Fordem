**Action items**  
* Find another meeting time during the week - invite Lukas  
* Add @lukas-h handle to conversations and PRs - Lukas will reply  daily  
* In the beginning we will create a protected ‘release’ branch.  
@lukas-h @zanzendegi will propose a strategy  
* Clear the todo and inProgress tasks in the kanban board of app, backend and website till the end of the month
  

**Suggestions**:  
@zanzendegi:   
* In the next meet all participants share a doc (preferably Markdown) and collaborate in the note taking and highlighting of the items.
* Then the project director will transpile the notes into the project Themes and Epics. (@armantorkzaban , maybe you?)
* The UX designers (and everyone) then create User Storys and verify if we are on the path.
* Then other members derive the Tasks from the Themes/Epics. And assign them.
