**Notus** is a rich text document model for [Zefyr][] project.

## Important! 

This is one of the dev releases for the upcoming 1.0 
release of both Notus and Zefyr packages. The work just started 
and there is not a lot of documentation yet but you can get a 
glimpse of what's coming by checking CHANGELOG.md of both packages.

**It is not yet recommended migrating real projects to use this 
version, things may break in unexpected ways.**

However you're free to try it out for educational or exploratory
purposes.

If you found a bug or have a feature request, please file it at 
the [issue tracker][].

For documentation, please see the main [Zefyr][] repository.

Notus is a **generic Dart package** and does not depend
on Flutter in any way. It can be used on any platform supported
by the Dart language: web, server (mac, linux, windows) and,
of course, mobile (android and ios).
