**e-Democracy platforms and how forDem stands out**  

Every e-Democracy platform must have the following four core functionlities/features fully fledged in it: 
- `Transparency`
- `Networking`
- `Deliberation`
- `Participation`

**This makes forDem unique:**  
* Next to the four core pillars mentioned above forDem will offer `peer-to-peer connectivity`, `decentralised storage` & `onion-routing`.
